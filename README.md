# Troubleshoot

If it doesn't work ingame and your device vibrated and is connected after launching the game :

Maybe you have or had more than two protube devices and the one you use are not working.
In any case unpair any protube device you don't want to use from your pc in the settings in windows.
Delete the configuration files leftHand.pro and rightHand.pro if any in the folder /Mods/dualwield/
